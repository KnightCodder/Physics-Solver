# Physics-Solver
 this is an AI software which would take physics and maths problems as input and give output and explanation as output.

# Things i need to learn before creating this project
i need to learn how to translate language to important parameters using machine learning. i already know how to create some simple machine learning models but i havent tried anything like a translator. so this project would be a good starting point to learn this. also this is going to be a very useful and real world project.

# Basic code structure
first i need to create some classes which can symbolise a enviroment, after that i am going to use physics formulas and solve the problem. i need to use machine learning to convert input into the symbolise environment and also to explain the solution.
